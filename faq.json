    "title": "What distinguishes the driving behavior of an electric car?",
    "content": "The braking behavior of the electric vehicle is also different. In addition to the conventional braking system, electric vehicles utilize Regenerative Braking.  Here, when the accelerator pedal is released, the electric motor is used as a generator and kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy. In this process, the car slows down.  In some cases, Regenerative Braking is so powerful that the conventional brakes rarely need to be used."
